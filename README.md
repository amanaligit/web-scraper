# web-scraper
a simple web scraper for automating stuff on sites such as flipkart, ycombinator, instagram. The app uses the node module called nightmare to automate web surfing which uses the fast electron browser. Cheerio is used for extracting data from the web-page's html content generated by nightmare.

for using instagram, create a .env file in the project folder with following details:

INSTA_USERNAME=<your instagram username>
INSTA_PASSWORD=<your instagram password>
ACCOUNT_FROM_WHICH_TO_FOLLOW=<the other instagram account you want to follow people from>
FOLLOWS_TO_DO=<number of follows to do>

run "npm run instagram" or "npm run news" or "npm run flipkart". 

Note: don't excessively use the instagram bot without a proxy, instragram can easily detect you are a bot and ban you.
